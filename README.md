----

## Overview of the Project: (5 to 6 lines)

Sentiment analysis helps us extract, score, classify and visualize the feelings and opinions that our customers display in their reviews of our business. Are they expressing opinions or feelings that are positive, negative or neutral?

## Goals ( 2 to 3 points)

The aim for your project is to classifying the positive and negative reviews of the customers and building a supervised learning model to polarize (to cause something, especially something that contains different people or opinions) large amounts of reviews.

## Key Highlights of the Project: (4 to 5 points)

This is an e-commerce problem statement. A good review can make your product stand apart from the competitors and in the same way a bad review can be a deal breaker. So to boost sales we need to understand the customer mood. The dataset you will work on contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon for the product with the most comments in the electronics products category.

## Expected Outcomes: (4 to 5 points)

You are supposed to classify the user comments. When a comment is received using a machine learning method, try to achieve a good success rate in predicting whether it is positive or negative. Also, find the percentage like how much of our predictions were successful.
